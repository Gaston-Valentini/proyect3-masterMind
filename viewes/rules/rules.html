            <div class="text">
                Are you ready to test your mind with this challenging game? Let's get started...<br><br>
                <div class="instruction">1. Choose your nickname and select a difficulty level:</div><br>
                Depending on the difficulty level you choose, you'll need to select a different number of colors, and you'll have more or fewer attempts:<br><br>

                Silly: 4 colors and 10 attempts<br>
                Smart: 5 colors and 8 attempts<br>
                Prodigy: 6 colors and 6 attempts<br>
                X-RAYS: 8 colors and 4 attempts<br><br>
                <div class="instruction">2. Select the colors you will play with:</div><br>
                You must choose the number of colors according to the difficulty level you have selected. Then, a hidden winning combination will be generated for you, which may or may not repeat the same color since it is entirely random.<br><br>

                <div class="instruction">3. Play the round:</div><br>
                The board will display the color selector and the "check" and "delete" buttons. These buttons will allow you to check if the combination you have created is correct and will delete the last color, respectively. If your combination is correct, you will win the round, and it will display the results of your victory. If it is incorrect, you will move on to the next row and lose an attempt. If you run out of attempts, you will lose the round.<br><br>

                Every time you click "check," the circular indicators will show whether you have guessed the combination of colors you have chosen. They will turn black if you have guessed the color and the position correctly, and white if that color exists in the winning combination but is not in that position.<br><br>

                Good luck, and enjoy the experience!
